    "The idea for this document is to explore building differentially private machine learning classifiers. Specifically, we will focus on a supervised learning problem: given labeled training samples $\\{(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$, we want to learn a classifier $f$ that can predict the label $y$ for a new sample $x$. We will focus on the case where $y$ is binary, i.e. $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$."
